General purpose spambot designed to keep my account active on the FTL site while I sleep

Load whatever text file you want, make sure the settings you want are correct, hit start and in 5 seconds the script will begin outputting chunks of text at the selected size at the selected rate

Default is 190 character chunks every 12 seconds so it's not too spammy (spam isn't exactly the intent for this, despite it being possible)

Repeat is turned off by default, repeat just keeps going after the file has been output when turned on.

Clipboard mode is a more manual version, when enabled it will cycle a new block of text into your clipboard every time you press ctrl+v

This was written ENTIRELY by prompting ChatGPT, it took over 100 prompts to get it to this point.

I am not a programmer, this will likely include innefficient uses of code, I wouldn't know any different
